# Python - Import & Modules
## Objectives
* Python Programming and how to import functions as well as creating modules
### [0. Import a simple function from a simple file](./0-add.py)
> Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
### [1. My first toolbox](./calculator_1.py)
> Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
### [2. How to make a script dynamic](./2-args.py)
> Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
### [3. Infinite addition](./3-infinite_add.py)
> Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
### [4. Who are you?](./4-hidden_discovery.py)
> Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc
### [5. Everything can be imported](./5-variable_load.py)
> Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value
### [6. Build my own calculator](./100-my_calculator.py)
> Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basics operations.
### [7. Easy print](./101-easy_print.py)
> Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
### [8. ByteCode -> Python #3]
> Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
### [9. Fast alphabet](./103-fast_alphabet.py)
> Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
